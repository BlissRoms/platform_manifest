Getting Started 
---------------

To get started with Android/Bliss, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the Bliss trees, use this command:


    repo init -u https://github.com/BlissRoms/platform_manifest.git -b n7.1-caf

Then to sync up:

    repo sync -c -j8 --force-sync --no-clone-bundle --no-tags

This(j#) depends on number of cpu cores - use just "repo sync" if you are unsure.

To build for your device.

. build/envsetup.sh

breakfast `device name here`

brunch `device name here`

or make it all in one line.

. build/envsetup.sh && breakfast `device name here` && brunch `device name here`

***
